# Apache Kafka with StorageOS

Kafka is a popular stream processing platform combining features from pub/sub
and traditional queues.

This repository is part of our use-case documentation and provides example YAML manifests to help you get started on running [Kafka with StorageOS](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/usecases/kubernetes/kafka).

Please visit the official docs page and please do leave us feedback for improvement or simply open a PR.

## Note

This example deployment of Kafka requires Apache Zookeeper to be present, you can find the necessary example manifests [here](../zookeeper) and also find the relevant documentation to run [Zookeeper with StorageOS](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/usecases/kubernetes/zookeeper).
